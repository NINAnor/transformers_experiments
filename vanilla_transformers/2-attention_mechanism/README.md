## Part 1: Understanding the Attention Mechanism

### Basic Concept
The attention mechanism in transformers is a way for the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing each part of the output sequence. It's akin to how we, as humans, pay attention to different words in a sentence to understand its meaning.

### Components of Attention
- **Queries (Q)**: These are representations of the current word (or part of a sentence) we're trying to process or generate.
- **Keys (K)**: These represent all the words in the input sequence that the current word (query) might be related to.
- **Values (V)**: These are also representations of all the words in the input sequence, similar to keys. The difference is in how they're used.

### The Attention Function
The attention function maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. The output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

## Part 2: The Scaled Dot-Product Attention

### The Formula
The most commonly used attention function in transformers is the scaled dot-product attention. The formula is:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Here, $(Q)$, $(K)$, and $(V)$ are matrices representing the queries, keys, and values, respectively. $( d_k )$ is the dimensionality of the keys.

### Breaking Down the Formula
- **Dot Product of Q and K**: We calculate the dot product of the query with all keys. This represents the similarity between the query and each key.
- **Scaling**: We scale this dot product by dividing it by $( \sqrt{d_k} )$. This is to avoid large values of the dot product, which can push the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients.
- **Softmax**: We apply a softmax function to get the weights of the values. This step converts the scores into probabilities (all positive and sum to 1).
- **Multiply by V**: Finally, we multiply the softmax scores with the value matrix $( V )$. This step produces a weighted sum of the values, weighted by how relevant each key is to the query.

## Part 3: Algebra and Calculations

### Dot Product
The dot product is a key operation in the attention mechanism. It's calculated as follows:

Given two vectors $( x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] )$ and $( y = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n])$, their dot product is:

$$
x \cdot y = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + ... + x_ny_n
$$

### Softmax Function
The softmax function converts a vector of numbers into a vector of probabilities. For a vector \( x \) of length \( n \), the softmax function is defined as:

$$
\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{x_j}}
$$

## Part 4: Example and Calculation

Let's consider a simple example:

Suppose we have one query $( Q = [3, 5] )$, two keys $( K = [[2, 4], [6, 8]] )$, and two values $( V = [[1, 3], [5, 7]] )$. Assume $( d_k = 2 )$.
We will compute the attention for this query.

I will continue with the calculations and a more detailed explanation in the next post. Let's first check if this initial part is clear and if you have any questions before we move on.

## Part 5: Detailed Example Calculation

Let's continue with our example:

### Setup:
- Query $( Q = [3, 5] )$
- Keys $( K = [[2, 4], [6, 8]] )$
- Values $( V = [[1, 3], [5, 7]] )$
- Dimension of Keys $( d_k = 2 )$

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Dot Product between Q and K:
- Calculate the dot product between the query and each key:
  - $( Q \cdot K_1 = [3, 5] \cdot [2, 4] = 3 \times 2 + 5 \times 4 = 26 )$
  - $( Q \cdot K_2 = [3, 5] \cdot [6, 8] = 3 \times 6 + 5 \times 8 = 58 )$
- The results are $( [26, 58] )$.

#### Scaling:
- Divide each dot product by $( \sqrt{d_k} = \sqrt{2} )$:
  - $( \frac{26}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 18.38 )$
  - $( \frac{58}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 41.01 )$
- The scaled scores are $( [18.38, 41.01] $).

#### Softmax:
- Apply the softmax function to the scaled scores:
  - $( \text{softmax}([18.38, 41.01]) )$
  - This involves calculating the exponential of each score and then normalizing by the sum of these exponentials:
    - $( e^{18.38} \approx 9.39 \times 10^7 \), \( e^{41.01} \approx 6.69 \times 10^{17} $)
    - $( \text{softmax}(18.38) \approx \frac{9.39 \times 10^7}{9.39 \times 10^7 + 6.69 \times 10^{17}} \approx 0 $)
    - $( \text{softmax}(41.01) \approx \frac{6.69 \times 10^{17}}{9.39 \times 10^7 + 6.69 \times 10^{17}} \approx 1 )$
- The softmax scores are approximately $( [0, 1] )$.

#### Multiply by V:
- Multiply the softmax scores by the values:
  - The weighted sum is \( 0 \times [1, 3] + 1 \times [5, 7] = [5, 7] \).
- The final output of the attention mechanism for this query is \( [5, 7] \).


### Another more concrete example

## Example Sentence
- Sentence: "The quick brown fox"
- Tokens: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"]

## Step 1: Tokenization and Embedding
- "The" → `[1, 0, 0]`
- "quick" → `[0, 1, 0]`
- "brown" → `[0, 0, 1]`
- "fox" → `[1, 1, 0]`

## Step 2: Initializing Q, K, V
- Q, K, V matrices: `[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]` (each `[4, 3]`)

## Step 3: Calculating the Attention Scores
- Calculate dot product of Q and K^T (transpose of K).
- 4x4 matrix for dot product; example calculation for "The":
  - "The" with "The": `1*1 + 0*0 + 0*0 = 1`
  - "The" with "quick": `1*0 + 0*1 + 0*0 = 0`
  - "The" with "brown": `1*0 + 0*0 + 0*1 = 0`
  - "The" with "fox": `1*1 + 0*1 + 0*0 = 1`
- First row of dot product matrix: `[1, 0, 0, 1]`
- Total dot product matrix: `[ [1, 0, 0, 1], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [1,1,0,0] ]`

## Step 4: Scale and Apply Softmax
- Scale matrix by `sqrt(3)`.
- Apply softmax to each row; for first row `[1, 0, 0, 1]`:
  - After scaling: `[1/√3, 0, 0, 1/√3]`
  - Softmax: `exp(1/√3) / (exp(1/√3) + exp(0) + exp(0) + exp(1/√3)) ≈ 0.42`
  - Approximate softmax scores: `[0.42, 0.16, 0.16, 0.42]`

## Step 5: Apply Attention to V
- Multiply softmax scores with V and sum along rows; for first row:
  - `0.42 * [1, 0, 0] + 0.16 * [0, 1, 0] + 0.16 * [0, 0, 1] + 0.42 * [1, 1, 0] = [0.84, 0.58, 0.16]`

## Summary
- Each word is analyzed in context of every other word.
- Resulting vectors blend original embeddings, weighted by attention scores.
- Captures contextual relationships within the sentence.
