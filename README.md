# Transformers experiments

## Aim of this repository

This repository is experimental and contain code and bits of information for understanding, building and running transformer networks, with a focus on acoustic data.

## Resources to understand transformers

**Seminal papers:**

- [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
- [An image is worth 16x16 words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)

**Other cool papers:**

- [A survey of transformers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666651022000146)
- [A Survey of Audio Classification Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10258355)

**Pre-trained transformers for acoustic data:**

- [BEATs](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beats). But better to use [our repository](https://github.com/NINAnor/rare_species_detections) as it contains a running example on ESC50.
- [AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast)
- [PaSST: Efficient Training of Audio Transformers with Patchout](https://github.com/kkoutini/PaSST)

**Tutorials related to transformers:**
